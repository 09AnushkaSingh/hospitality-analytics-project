# Hospitality Analytics Project: Performance Analysis

## Project Overview
### This project delivers a comprehensive, data-driven analysis of hotel booking and revenue performance for AtliQ Hotels, a fictional hospitality brand. Using real-world data analytics techniques, the project uncovers key insights into booking patterns, occupancy trends, customer behavior and revenue distribution across cities, hotel categories and booking platforms.


## Problem Statement & Objectives
The hospitality industry relies heavily on demand forecasting, occupancy management and customer insights. This project addresses the need to systematically analyze booking and operational data to improve business outcomes.

## The main objectives include:
Understanding occupancy efficiency across hotel categories and cities
Analyzing booking trends month-wise and platform-wise
Identifying revenue drivers across hotels and customer segments
Examining guest ratings and customer satisfaction indicators
Combining fact and dimension tables to build a unified analytical dataset
Supporting data-driven decisions for operational and revenue improvements

## Data Source
The analysis uses five structured CSV datasets:
dim_date.csv – Date attributes (month, weekday, year, etc.)
dim_hotels.csv – Hotel-level information (category, city, name)
dim_rooms.csv – Room categories and capacity
fact_aggregated_bookings.csv – Monthly aggregated occupancy and capacity
fact_bookings.csv – Individual booking-level details (ratings, guests, platform, revenue)

## Tools Used
Python (Pandas, NumPy, Matplotlib, Seaborn)
Jupyter Notebook
Data Cleaning & Pre-processing Techniques
Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)
Statistical Aggregation & Group-by Operations
